# Our Activites  

**Dalbeattie Men's Shed** has the resources to undertake a number of very varied activities. If you are new to these skills, please remember to ask for help from other more experienced members. That's the "Shedding" experience! Please ensure you are signed off on any machines before you use them.

## Woodworking

Woodworking is our primary activity in our **very well equipped woodworking shop**. We have a number of trade-rated machines including a 12" saw table, a planer/thicknesser, a router table, two band saws and two woodturning lathes.

We engage in a diverse range of woodworking projects from bird and squirrel feeders and chopping boards to bookcases and cupboards, from turned candlestick holders to custom-built honours boards. We've even made a trebuchet and a soapbox car in which we came fourth in the Castle Douglas Soapbox Derby in 2018 .

## Metalworking

With the aid of a grant, The Shed managed to purchase tools to punch, shear, bend, roll and rivet together strip and bar and to make decorative scrolls and twists. This equipment makes it easy to create many metalcraft designs such as gates and railings, various decorative brackets and garden ornaments. Our shed members made up a purpose-built table to hold all the tools.  We also have a metal turning lathe and welding booth.
